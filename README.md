### Hello ðŸ‘‹ my name is Mami. 

About year ago, I decided to challenge myself with enrolled in online courses, graduated from the Nucamp Full-Stack Coding Bootcamp, and created catcafe web front with react and react native as if I am opening the cafe. It is not real however I love cats and coffee. I am currently on my search for an entry-level position or internship in Pacific Northwest.

I would like to focus on improving my javascript skills, but I am very open to collaborating on a variety of projects.
